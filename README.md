# Case Study: Custom WordPress Boat Rental Booking System

## Overview
To streamline and optimize the boat rental booking process, we developed a fully customized WordPress-based solution utilizing Custom Post Types (CPT), Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), and Gravity Forms. This system ensures seamless rental management, scheduling flexibility, and an efficient approval workflow for both administrators and customers.

## Challenges
Before implementing the custom booking system, the client faced several operational inefficiencies, including:
- **Manual Booking Approvals:** Administrators had to manually approve or reject each booking, leading to delays.
- **Limited Scheduling Flexibility:** The lack of an automated system made it difficult to manage time slots effectively.
- **No Centralized Data Management:** Keeping track of boat availability and customer bookings required multiple tools.
- **Potential Double Bookings:** Without a structured approval system, the risk of overlapping reservations was high.

## Solution
To address these challenges, we built a robust WordPress booking system that integrates CPTs, ACF, and Gravity Forms, enabling seamless management of boat rentals.

### Key Features

âœ… **Admin Approval System**
- Admins can approve, reject, or manage bookings from both the frontend and backend.
- The booking status updates automatically upon approval or rejection.

âœ… **Custom Post Types**
1. **Boat Rentals (boat-rental):** Stores details of available boats for rent.
2. **Bookings (booking):** Manages reservations and their statuses.

âœ… **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Structure**
We structured the booking system with ACF field groups to store essential boat rental and booking details.

### Boat Rental Details

|----------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Boat Name           | boat_name              | Text         |
| Booking Hours       | booking_hours          | Number       |
| Hourly Rental Price | hourly_rental_price    | Number       |
| Boat Time Slots     | boat_time_slots        | Repeater     |
| Calendar Start Date | calendar_start_date    | Date Picker  |
| Calendar End Date   | calendar_end_date      | Date Picker  |

ðŸ”¹ **Boat Time Slots (Repeater Fields)**
- **Time Slot (time_slot):** Type: Time Picker

### Boat Booking Status
| Label          | Field Name       | Type   |
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| Boat ID       | boat_id         | Text   |
| Time Duration | time_duration   | Text   |
| Client Name   | client_name     | Text   |
| Booking Email | booking_email   | Text   |
| Booking Date  | booking_date    | Text   |
| Time Slot     | time_slot       | Text   |
| Booking Status| booking_status  | Select |

ðŸ”¹ **Booking Status Options:**
- Confirmed
- Pending (Default)
- Cancelled

## Implementation Process
### Step 1: Custom Post Types Setup
Using CPT UI, we created two custom post types: `boat-rental` for boat listings and `booking` for managing reservations.

### Step 2: ACF Field Group Creation
We structured ACF fields to capture all necessary data for boat rentals and bookings, ensuring seamless data storage and retrieval.

### Step 3: Gravity Forms Integration
Gravity Forms was used to create a dynamic booking form, allowing users to select available boats, choose time slots, and submit requests. The form automatically generates a new `booking` post with a default status of "Pending."

### Step 4: Admin Approval Workflow
- Upon submission, admins receive a notification.
- They can review and approve/reject the booking via the WordPress dashboard.
- Once approved, the system updates the status and sends a confirmation email to the client.

### Step 5: Calendar & Availability Management
- The boat availability is dynamically updated to prevent double bookings.
- ACF date fields enable easy filtering of available boats within a specific timeframe.

## Results & Impact
âœ… **Efficiency Improvement:** Automated approvals and centralized booking management significantly reduced admin workload.
âœ… **Improved User Experience:** Clients can easily book boats and receive instant updates on their booking status.
âœ… **Elimination of Double Bookings:** The system dynamically updates availability, ensuring no overlaps.
âœ… **Scalability:** The solution is easily extendable to add new features like online payments and automated reminders.

## Conclusion
By leveraging WordPress CPTs, ACF, and Gravity Forms, we successfully built a highly functional, user-friendly boat rental booking system. The solution streamlined operations, improved efficiency, and enhanced the booking experience for both customers and administrators. ðŸš€
